//The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
// It's useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, like managing resources or configuration settings.

public class SingletonDP {
    private static volatile SingletonDP obj;  //volatile prevents instruction reordering and ensures visibility across threads by avoiding half-constructed objects.

/*
Common Issues with Singleton in Multithreading:
1. Race Condition During Lazy Initialization
If two threads simultaneously check whether the singleton instance is null, both may proceed to create a new instance, resulting in multiple instances — breaking the Singleton guarantee.

solutions:
1. Eager Initialization  --> Not lazy (may waste resources if the instance is never used)
2. Synchronized method --> Poor performance — every call is synchronized
3. Double-Checked Locking (with volatile)  --> Better performance
