//The Factory DP is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
//Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.

//Super class in factory design pattern can be an interface, abstract class or a normal java class
